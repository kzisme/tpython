Think Python || Chapter 2
=======================

Values and types are items we work with like 1,2, and "Hello World".

The numbers would count as integers, and "Hello World" would be a string. 

Next, we have variables which are simply names that refer to values in our
program. 

```
n = 17
message = 'December'
```

Variable names must start with a letter - and it's beneficial to use lower case
letters to begin a variable's name.  You can also use an underscore to begin a
variable name.

It is also important to remember that Python has **keywords** that are saved for
the language's use.

There are many operators in Python but the new // operator in Python3 performs
floor division, but the division operator always returns a floating point.

Expressions are combonations of values, variables, and operators.  A statement
is a piece of code Python can interpret such as:

```
x + 17
```

The important thing to remember is that expressions hold value where a
statement does not.  

In general you are unable to perform mathematical operations on strings - BUT
you are able to concatenate strings using the + operator.  

It is also worth mentioning that the * operator performs repitition.  

So...

```
'Kevin'*3
```
Will give us: 
```
KevinKevinKevin
```

Comments in Python are denoted by using a # symbol.  Currently there is no
operation to block quotes in Python.

**Note - there will be no exercise for this chapter because the exercise is
just determining values after applying operations to them.**
